Recipes

This is a combination of the vue todo list and lab 5

I will have a login and suggested recipes from an api for all users.

Once added to Digital Ocean, it will be secured.

Home:
    sees a gallery of all the ingredients and their pictures
    Functionality: //will only be on their individual accounts
        can click on individual recipes and see a larger photo of it as well as a list of items for it.

Dashboard:
    image of the food or image they upload
    description should just be the name of the food and maybe a bit of what kind of food it is.
    Functionality: //will only be on their individual accounts
        Create - can add their own recipes
        Edit - can edit recipes
        Delete - can delete the recipes they added only. Can not delete suggessted recipes.

Todo List:
    has a list of their ingredients.
    Functionality: //will only be on their individual accounts
        Create: can add ingredients or cooking instruction - see if you can allow the user to change the order of  
            items
        Edit: maybe add functionality to edit the items on the list; Can cross items off list - cannot be permanent
        Delete: can delete items from their list

How it is different from previous projects:
    added a todo-list to all recipes that will be created when it is added or created by the user or api.
    use an aditional api to gather more recipes
